# Deno_Learning_Journey
Deno is a nwe tool for us to run JS outside of the browser
--> 1. support JS and TS
--> 2. supports URL imports and modern JS features
--> 3. so called 'secure by default' and require execution permissions

### Inspired by Node.js
In fact, Deno is created by the founder of the Node.js which is created to solve and improve the bug and features of Node.JS
--> 1. Node only support JS but not TS
--> 2. Nod.js doesn't know execution permissions which refers to any scripts can do anything

### What can you build with Deno?
- build any kind of websites with Deno
- server-side rendered with views templating engines 
- APIs like REST AND GRAPHql APIs

There are numerous updates and improvements and lets start to explore it now!

## What kind of Web App do we want to Build?
1. APIs (provides endpoints which return json file â€” data) 
-> require standalone frontend app
2. Server-side rendered view (HTML element) 


## Using "Oak" and Dynamic Template
Oak is a middleware-focused Deno framework for building web-application
--> inspired by the "Koa" from "node.js"

### Comparison between setting up the web server manually and using Oak
'''
//Set up the server by Oak
import {Application, Router} from 'https://deno.land/x/oak/mod.ts'; //can specific the version for improving the stability 

const app = new Application();

const router = new Router();

router.get('/', (ctx) => {
 ctx.response.body = 
 `<h1>Welcome to Deno Land</h1>
  <form action="/land" method="POST"
   <input tyoe="text" name="new">
   <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>`;
  
  ctx.response.type = 'text/html';
 });
 
router.post('/land', async(ctx) => {
   const body = await ctx.request.body();
   const new = body.value.get('new');
   ctx.response.redirect('/');
  });
 
app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
  console.log('Middleware');
  await next();
})

app.use(router.routes());
app.use(router.allowedMethods());


await app.listen({port: 3000});
